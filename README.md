# PersonalizedExercisePWA

Offline-first PWA scaffold for a local-only exercise tracker.

## Features in this scaffold
- App shell caching via Service Worker.
- IndexedDB storage with a single `app_state` JSON blob and a `media` fallback store.
- OPFS media utilities with IndexedDB fallback.
- Basic project rendering, beep previews, and XML export stub for a sample project.

## Next steps
- Build project/set/step editors and the workout player UI.
- Add ZIP-based XML import/export with media packaging.
- Implement the beep engine with Web Audio scheduling.
